        <h2>Objective:</h2>

        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            The Project Expo begins with an initial registration phase, during which students submit their personal details and confirm their participation. Each participating team must consist of a maximum of 3 members, ensuring a balanced distribution of tasks and collaboration. Once registration is complete, teams receive guidance on event requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the day of the event, participants arrive early to set up their project displays at designated booths. Each display area is equipped with basic necessities like tables, power outlets, and any additional resources requested in advance. A team of volunteers is available to assist participants with setup to ensure each project is presented professionally and efficiently. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As the event commences, participants present their projects to a panel of judges and an audience that includes students, faculty, and external visitors. Each project is allotted a specific time for presentation, where participants explain their project’s objectives, technical details, and potential real-world applications. Attendees are encouraged to engage with the presenters, ask questions, and provide feedback, fostering an interactive and collaborative environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following the presentation period, judges conduct evaluations based on set criteria like innovation, technical depth, clarity of presentation, and societal impact. This thorough assessment ensures that each project is recognized for its unique strengths. After evaluations, the expo culminates in an awards ceremony, where the top projects are honored. These awards not only recognize exceptional talent but also inspire all participants to continue innovating and refining their skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Project Expo provides an excellent networking opportunity as students connect with industry professionals, faculty members, and fellow innovators. Feedback collected from attendees and judges is shared with participants to help them refine their projects further, contributing to their professional growth and encouraging continuous learning.
